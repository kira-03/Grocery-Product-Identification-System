# Grocery Product Identification System

An advanced image-based grocery product identification system using pre-trained TensorFlow models (ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet169). Inspired by Amazon Go, this project combines computer vision and machine learning for automated stock monitoring and seamless payments.

## üöÄ Features

- **End-to-End Full-Stack Solution**: React frontend with FastAPI backend
- **Pre-trained TensorFlow Models**: ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet169 for high-accuracy classification
- **Optimized Image Processing**: Combined OpenCV and PIL for efficient preprocessing
- **Custom Model Selection**: Multiple models for tailored predictions based on accuracy/speed needs
